## Overview

Segmentation of ultra-high resolution images is increasingly demanded in a wide range of applications (e.g. urban planning), yet poses signiﬁcant challenges for algorithm efficiency, in particular considering the (GPU) memory limits.

We propose collaborative **Global-Local Networks (GLNet)** to effectively preserve both global and local information in a highly memory-efficient manner.

* **Memory-efficient**: **training w. only one 1080Ti** and **inference w. less than 2GB GPU memory**, for ultra-high resolution images of up to 30M pixels.

* **High-quality**: GLNet outperforms existing segmentation models on ultra-high resolution images.

GLNet (red dots) integrates both global and local information in a compact way, contributing to a well-balanced trade-off between accuracy and memory usage.</br>

<b>GLNet</b>: the global and local branch takes downsampled and cropped images, respectively. Deep feature map sharing and feature map regularization enforce our global-local collaboration. The final segmentation is generated by aggregating high-level feature maps from two branches.

<b>Deep feature map sharing</b>: at each layer, feature maps with global context and ones with local fine structures are bidirectionally brought together, contributing to a complete patch-based deep global-local collaboration.
